## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Speak naturally** - Don't read from notes
2. **Use STAR method** - Situation, Task, Action, Result
3. **Include numbers** - "Improved by 60%", "5 years experience"
4. **Give examples** - Specific projects and outcomes
5. **Aim for 20-50 words** - Not too short, not too long

### Good Answer Structure

```
"When I [situation], I [action] which resulted in [result].
For example, when building [specific project], I used [technology]
and achieved [quantified outcome]."
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Microphone permission required"**
→ Grant permission in Android settings

**"Speech recognition not available"**
→ Ensure internet connection (required for speech API)

**"AI takes too long"**
→ Normal! Gemini analysis takes 2-3 seconds

**"No speech detected"**
→ Speak louder or check mic isn't blocked

**"TTS not speaking"**
→ Check device volume and TTS engine installed
