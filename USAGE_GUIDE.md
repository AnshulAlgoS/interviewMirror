## 💬 Understanding AI Feedback

The AI interviewer is **brutally honest** (in a helpful way!):

### 🟢 Great Answer (20+ words, specific)

```
"Great answer with good details! You provided 
concrete examples which shows real experience. 
How would you handle X situation?"
```

### 🟡 Okay Answer (10-20 words)

```
"That's a good start, but can you give me 
a SPECIFIC example? What exactly did you do?"
```

### 🔴 Weak Answer (<10 words)

```
"That's quite vague. I need you to elaborate 
more. Can you walk me through a real scenario?"
```

### ⚪ Silent/No Answer

```
"I didn't hear anything. Take your time - 
want me to repeat the question?"
```

## 📞 Interview Domains

### 💻 Tech Domain

**Question Types:**

- Algorithms & data structures
- System design
- Past projects
- Technical challenges
- Coding approach

**Good Answer Example:**
*"When I built the payment service, I chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because we needed ACID
transactions for financial data. I designed the schema with proper indexing which reduced query time
by 60%."*

### 👥 HR Domain

**Question Types:**

- Tell me about yourself
- Why this company?
- Conflict resolution
- Leadership examples
- Career goals

**Good Answer Example:**
*"In my last role, I led a team of 5 developers. When two team members disagreed on architecture, I
organized a design review meeting where we evaluated both approaches with pros/cons. This
collaborative process led to a hybrid solution that satisfied both concerns."*

### 📦 Product Domain

**Question Types:**

- Product strategy
- User research
- Prioritization
- Metrics definition
- Stakeholder management

**Good Answer Example:**
*"When prioritizing features, I used the RICE framework: Reach (100k users), Impact (8/10),
Confidence (70%), Effort (2 weeks). This gave a score of 280, making it our top priority over the
notification feature which scored 150."*

### 🎨 Design Domain

**Question Types:**

- Design process
- User empathy
- Portfolio walkthrough
- Design decisions
- Collaboration with engineers

**Good Answer Example:**
*"For the checkout redesign, I conducted 15 user interviews and found that 80% abandoned at the
payment step due to trust issues. I added trust badges, simplified the form from 12 to 6 fields, and
included progress indicators. Post-launch, abandonment dropped from 65% to 22%."*
