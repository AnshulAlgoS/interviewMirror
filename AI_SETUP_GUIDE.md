---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### 1. **Transcript Generation (Simulates User Speech)**

```kotlin
RunAnywhereSDK → GeminiAIService.generateInterviewResponse()
```

- Generates realistic candidate responses
- Includes natural filler words (um, like, actually)
- Domain-specific content

### 2. **AI Analysis (Real Interviewer Feedback)**

```kotlin
RunAnywhereSDK → AIConversationManager.analyzeUserResponse()
```

- Analyzes the transcript like a real interviewer
- Provides personalized feedback
- Identifies strengths and areas to improve
- Generates relevant follow-up questions
- Maintains conversation context

### 3. **Results Display**

- 💬 **Interviewer Feedback**: Conversational, honest analysis

## 🔍 Verify AI is Working

### Check #1: Analyzing Screen

Look for:

```
🤖 AI Interviewer Analyzing...
Gemini AI is evaluating your response
```

### Check #2: Feedback Screen

Look for these AI-generated sections:

- 💬 **Interviewer Feedback** (conversational, unique)
- 🎯 **Confidence Assessment**
- ✨ **Strengths** (specific to your answer)
- 📈 **Areas to Improve** (personalized)
- ❓ **Follow-up Question** (contextual)

### Check #3: Different Feedback Each Time

- Answer the same question multiple times
- You'll get different feedback and follow-ups each time
- This proves AI is analyzing dynamically!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key not valid"

**Solution:**

1. Double-check the API key in `local.properties`
2. Ensure no extra spaces before/after the key
3. Make sure you copied the entire key
4. Rebuild: `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`

### Issue: "Failed to initialize RunAnywhere SDK"

**Solution:**

- This is usually fine - the app will work in fallback mode
- If you want full AI, ensure internet connection

### Issue: No follow-up questions appearing

**Solution:**

- Check that you're not on the last question
- AI might decide no follow-up is needed
- Verify API key is configured correctly

### Issue: Same feedback every time

**Solution:**

- If feedback is identical, AI isn't being used
- Check `local.properties` has correct API key
- Rebuild and reinstall the app
- Check internet connection

## 🎯 Example: Before vs After

### Before (Static)

```
Question: "Tell me about yourself"
Response: [Generic feedback about speech rate]
Follow-up: None
```

### After (AI-Powered) 🔥

```
Question: "Tell me about yourself"

💬 Interviewer Feedback:
"Thanks for that introduction! You mentioned your five years in 
Android development which is great. I particularly liked how you 
highlighted specific technologies like Kotlin and Compose. It would 
be even stronger if you could quantify your impact - perhaps mention 
user numbers or app downloads?"

🎯 Confidence Assessment:
"Good delivery overall. You had a few hesitations ('um', 'like') 
which is natural, but your pace was appropriate and you maintained 
good structure in your answer."

✨ Strengths:
• Clear communication of technical experience
• Specific mention of modern technologies (Kotlin, Compose)

📈 Areas to Improve:
• Add quantifiable achievements (downloads, users, ratings)
• Reduce filler words for more polished delivery

❓ Follow-up Question:
"You mentioned working on production apps with millions of users. 
Can you walk me through your most challenging technical problem in 
one of those projects and how you solved it?"
```
