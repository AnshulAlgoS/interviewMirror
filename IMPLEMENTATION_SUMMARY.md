# Interview Mirror - Complete UI Overhaul & Two-Way Voice System Implementation

## üéØ Overview

Successfully transformed Interview Mirror from a basic mock interview app into a **fully
interactive, voice-driven, two-way interview simulator** with professional UI and complete Gemini
1.5 Flash AI integration.

**‚ú® NEW: Emulator Support** - Automatically detects emulators and provides a text input dialog for
typing answers, with simulated audio visualization!

---

```

### 4. **Enhanced ViewModel Architecture** üèóÔ∏è

- **NEW State Flows**:
    - `liveTranscript`: Real-time user speech transcription
    - `audioLevel`: Current audio input level (0-1)
    - `isSpeaking`: Whether AI is currently speaking

- **Two-Way Conversation Flow**:
    1. AI speaks question ‚Üí User listens
    2. User speaks ‚Üí Real-time transcription
    3. AI analyzes ‚Üí Gemini 1.5 Flash processing
    4. AI speaks feedback ‚Üí User receives verbal response
    5. Repeat with context-aware follow-ups

- **Key Methods**:
    - `speakQuestion()`: TTS for questions
    - `speakFeedback()`: TTS for AI analysis
    - `speakSummary()`: TTS for session results
    - Real-time speech observation from `RealTimeSpeechRecognizer`

### 5. **Improved SDK Architecture** üîß

- **RunAnywhereSDK Updates**:
    - NEW: `analyzeTranscript(transcript, duration)` - primary method
    - Uses real transcribed text instead of audio bytes
    - Legacy `analyzeAudio()` method deprecated but kept for compatibility
    - Direct integration with Gemini AI for honest feedback

- **Analysis Pipeline**:
  ```
  User Speech ‚Üí RealTimeSpeechRecognizer ‚Üí Live Transcript
  ‚Üì
  Stop Recording ‚Üí Final Transcript Captured
  ‚Üì
  SDK analyzeTranscript() ‚Üí Speech Metrics + AI Analysis
  ‚Üì
  Gemini 1.5 Flash ‚Üí Honest Feedback + Follow-up
  ‚Üì
  TTS speaks feedback ‚Üí User hears response
  ```

### 6. **Enhanced Permission Handling** üîê

- **MainActivity Updates**:
    - Proper permission state management with Compose
    - Runtime permission checks
    - Custom `PermissionDeniedDialog` with retry option
    - User-friendly messaging explaining why permission is needed

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Changes

#### **Dependency Injection (AppModule.kt)**

```kotlin
@Provides @Singleton
fun provideTextToSpeechService(context: Context): TextToSpeechService

@Provides @Singleton
fun provideRealTimeSpeechRecognizer(context: Context): RealTimeSpeechRecognizer
```

#### **Navigation Flow (InterviewNavigation.kt)**

- Passes `audioLevel` and `liveTranscript` to RecordingScreen
- Reactive UI updates based on StateFlow changes
- Smooth transitions between screens

### Key Algorithms

#### **Confidence Score Calculation**

```kotlin
Factors:
- Word count (40% weight) - penalizes very short answers
- Speech rate (30% weight) - ideal: 120-150 WPM
- Filler words (30% weight) - <5% is excellent
Final: Combined score 0.0 to 1.0
```

#### **Audio Level Normalization**

```kotlin
normalizedLevel = (rmsdB + 2f) / 12f
Clamped to 0.0 - 1.0 range
Used for waveform amplitude and visual feedback
```

    - "Great answer with good details!"
    - Genuine praise

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Short answers** (<10 words):
    - "That's quite vague - can you give me a specific example?"
    - Challenges for more detail

- ‚ùå **Weak answers** (generic, no examples):
    - "I need you to elaborate more"
    - Points out lack of substance

- üîá **Silent/No input**:
    - "I didn't hear anything. Take your time..."
    - Encouraging but honest

### Context-Aware Follow-ups

- AI remembers previous Q&A (conversation history)
- Generates intelligent follow-up questions
- Adapts difficulty based on performance
